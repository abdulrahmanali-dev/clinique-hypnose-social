## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge

each second flip one img after the page loads

### Solution

solved by creating an array that contains the names of the classes of the imgs that i want to flip, then iterate through them one by one,and adding 'flip' class to them, with a delay of 700ms using setTimeout

### Challenge

Creating accordion without bootstrap

### Solution

Stole the code from a codepen :)
but i know what each line do of course

## My preferences

#### Mobile First

i used Mobile First For the responsiveness of the site.
i don't only use this but i found it Appropriate for this design

> side note : i added only one librari during this project,    its owl-carousel for the carousel in the resources section
> i know i cheated :) but its unreasonable to spend my entire day trying to make this carousel work while i have something that works perfectly
